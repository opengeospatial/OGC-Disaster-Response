# OGC-Disaster-Response
OGC Disaster Response Repository


The following overview has been taken from the [OGC's Disaster Pilot 2021](https://www.ogc.org/projects/initiatives/dp21):

> A disaster strikes, piling on to or cascading into additional disaster situations. Overwhelming, but preparation and coordination of scalable response capacity meets the challenge. Disaster relief forces from supporting jurisdictions quickly integrate and analyze vast streams of realtime data from multiple sources to monitor the evolving situation and plan their responses. Hybrid scalable cloud-based systems bring advanced AI processing, machine learning algorithms, and simulation models right to where earth observation and other data is already uplinked, prepared, and curated, generating analysis ready data with the characteristics, scale and speed that the complex situation demands. Convenience APIâ€™s, as well as download-and-go geopackage containers and viewers, bring decision ready information directly to field workers' mobile devices even in resource-constrained, low-connectivity areas. Meanwhile, Web publication of "structured data" that link well-known content with up-to-the-minute situation observations enables search engines to push disaster-relevant information up in search results and help the public to stay on top of fast-moving events. All of this is possible through the preparation of technologies, geospatial standards, and data sharing arrangements that bring the right information at the right time to the right people in the right place.

This is the right place to start!
